The client requests a website that will contain information about JRPG (Japanese Role-Playing Game) franchises, including history, development, news and teasers, reviews, character bios, and information relevant to that particular franchise. The site will include a public site where users can read the information, as well as a private log-in site for staff of the client to log in and make changes or add content as needed.

For the purpose of this project, three franchises will be implemented: Persona, Atelier, and Xeno.
